# Orderli: Scheduler for Patient Safety, and Risk Management

## Summary

Orderli is a cutting-edge application designed for hospital risk managers. By leveraging machine learning, it predicts providersâ€™ risk of complication and suggests optimal scheduling adjustments. This ensures that the right providers are assigned to the right procedures, maximizing patient safety and clinical efficacy.

- **Optimized Scheduling:**  
By aligning provider risk with procedure scheduling, the app ensures that patients receive care from providers best suited for the procedure. This optimization leads to higher treatment efficacy and a reduction in complications.

- **Proactive Risk Identification:**  
The machine learning model continuously assesses risk, identifying providers who may present a higher likelihood of complications. This allows for early intervention before risks translate into actual safety issues.

- **Reduction of Complication Rates:**  
By suggesting rescheduling of certain procedures based on risk prediction, Orderli directly contributes to minimizing complications. This systematic approach to risk management plays a key role in enhancing patient safety.

- **Improved Resource Management:**  
The app aids in allocating provider resources more effectively, ensuring that the most suitable staff are scheduled for procedures. This targeted approach helps mitigate risks and enhances operational efficiency.
